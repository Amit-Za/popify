# Popify

Popify is a website designed to help pop collectors and pop owners in general orginize and sort their Funko pops.

## The Database

- The database it uses is a widely accessible Funko POP archive which gets updated by users and moderators frequently.
- If your pop doesn't exist in the database, you can add it with a simple form.

## Collection Management

- You can sort your pop into different collections based on your preferences or based on Funko's original sets.
- Collections can contain other sub collections.

## Social (sign up required)

- You can view other people's collections, and have the options to get notified whenever they make chagnes to their collections.
- You can create chats with other users to talk about pops, arrange trades, or negotiate prices.
